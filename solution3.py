# Write code for algorithm 3 below

# Write a function that returns the nth elements in the Fibonacci Sequence.

# The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
# For example, if n=4, then the result would be '2' and if n=2, the result would be '1'
# Here is more information on the Fibonacci Sequence.
# Hint: Look back at the factorial example as the structure of the algorithm may help you.
